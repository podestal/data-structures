# data-structures
This a repository to reinforce my knowledge in data structures, the programming language used for this goa, is going to be python. To describe the performance of the algorithms Big O notation will be used for time and space:
- O(1)	    -> Constant
- O(n)      -> Linear
- O(n^2)    -> Quadratic
- O(log n)  -> Logarithmic
- O(2^n)    -> Exponential

The repository is going to be organized with folders for each different data structures:
- Nodes
- LinkedList
  * Lookup by index    -> O(n)
  * Lookup by value    -> O(n)
  * Insert first/last  -> O(1)
  * Insert middle      -> O(n)
  * Delete first       -> O(1)
  * Delete middle/last -> O(n)
- Queues
  * enqueue            -> O(1)
  * dequeue            -> O(1)
  * peek               -> O(1)
  * isEmpty            -> O(1)
  * isFull             -> O(1)
- Stacks
  * push               -> O(1)
  * pop                -> O(1)
  * peek               -> O(1)
  * isEmpty            -> O(1)
