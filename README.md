# data-structures
This a repository to reinforce my knowledge in data structures, the programming language used for this goa, is going to be python. To describe the performance of the algorithms Big O notation will be used for time and space:
- O(1)	    -> Constant
- O(n)      -> Linear
- O(n^2)    -> Quadratic
- O(log n)  -> Logarithmic
- O(2^n)    -> Exponential

The repository is going to be organized with folders for each different data structures:
- Nodes
- LinkedList
